Can we build this out so that each user sees their own environment?
Can the app encourage users to start cooking? what about food meditations? can we develop different themes to honour the sources of our food?

* IDEA - The Calendar should utilize a "Suggestions" box based on the other meals that are on the calendar - and the suggestions should possibly change based on meal we have selected
* IDEA - We should have a trainer where the app asks us - (have you eaten this in the last week? last month? last year?) - to figure out what items you like to eat!

* right now the tool is not useful to me because it doesn't have enough data about the kinds of things I might want to eat
* I don't necessarily like the idea that you can click through multiple perdictions - the tool should not overwhelm the user with too many options
* Idea what about creating a way to track how often we eat at a resturant vs cooking at home? 
* Consider building ability to associate 'food items' to a resturant -drag and drop 
* Consider adding the ability to add ingredients to food items
* consider adding the ability to create meals from multiple food items
