* I would like to convert / replicate this entire application in Blazer Server side
* Build a abilty to have a custom themed plate
* Can the app encourage users to start cooking? what about food meditations? can we develop different themes to honour the sources of our food?
* prayers to the earth in thanksgiving for our food...
	* Farmers
	* Butchers
	* Delivery Drivers
	* All the hands it passed through to reach the user

* The Calendar should utilize a "Suggestions" box based on the other meals that are on the calendar - and the suggestions should possibly change based on meal we have selected
* We should have a trainer where the app asks us - (have you eaten this in the last week? last month? last year?) - to figure out what items you like to eat!

* right now the tool is not useful to me because it doesn't have enough data about the kinds of things I might want to eat
* I don't necessarily like the idea that you can click through multiple perdictions - the tool should not overwhelm the user with too many options
* Idea what about creating a way to track how often we eat at a resturant vs cooking at home? 
* Consider building ability to associate 'food items' to a resturant -drag and drop 
* Consider adding the ability to add ingredients to food items
* consider adding the ability to create meals from multiple food items
