-right now the tool is not useful to me because it doesn't have enough data about the kinds of things I might want to eat
-I don't necessarily like the idea that you can click through multiple perdictions - the tool should not overwhelm the user with too many options
-associate food item with resturant? OK
-[1] associate food item with MEAL - this is very important because if the meal feels incomplete we won't be modivated to eat it.
	--full meals--
	need to be able to add multiple food itmes together to CREATE A MEAL. we can name meals whatever we want - let's create a very simple admnistration to manage meals...

-[2] what about creating a way to track how often we eat at a resturant vs cooking at home? 

#Consider building ability to associate 'food items' to a resturant
	-drag and drop 
#Consider adding the ability to add ingredients to food items
#consider adding the ability to create meals from multiple food items
[2]#Create an Administration Tool?

IDEA - The Calendar should utilize a "Suggestions" box based on the other meals that are on the calendar - and the suggestions should possibly change based on meal we have selected
IDEA - We should have a trainer where the app asks us - (have you eaten this in the last week? last month? last year?) - to figure out what items you like to eat!
