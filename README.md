# MyKitchen

_My Kitchen_ or _What Should I Eat_ (not sure what the best name for this should be), is a tool to help me spend less time thinking about what to eat.

## Current Development
* finish adding user accounts - currently some data is global to all users
* I would like to run this as in an Azure App Service as a Progressive Web App - (so it can be used on a phone without being a mobile app)
* Add Test cases to make sure user accounts are working

## Existing Features
* Meal Planning Calendar
* What should I eat next advice
* Create a personal database of your favorite foods
* Combine Foods to make meals to simplify planning

## Learning Focus
* I am using this project to improve my knowledge of programming
* 11/14/2020 - Focus on creating Unit Tests

## Technical Specs
* Uses Azure KeyVault for User Secrets and Passwords
