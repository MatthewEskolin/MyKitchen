# MyKitchen

_My Kitchen_ or _What Should I Eat_ (not sure what the best name for this should be), is a tool to help me spend less time thinking about what to eat.

## Current Development
* I would like to add user accounts - currently all data is global to all users
* I would like to run this as in an Azure App Service as a Progressive Web App - (so it can be used on a phone without being a mobile app)

## Existing Features
* Meal Planning Calendar
* What should I eat next advice
* Create a personal database of your favorite foods
* Combine Foods to make meals to simplify planning
